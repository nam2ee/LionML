# Overview

Aleo EZKL is a library and command-line tool for doing inference for deep learning models and other computational graphs in a zk-snark specifically for **Aleo’s Varuna Circuit**. It branches off of the [**ezkl library by zkonduit](https://github.com/zkonduit/ezkl)** for Aleo developers so that generalized machine learning models can work on Aleo Ecosystem. 

# Problem

Aleo lacks zkml resources for developers. The current machine learning related libraries and toolings on [Awesome Aleo](https://github.com/howardwu/awesome-aleo?tab=readme-ov-file#machine-learning) are either outdated or limited in transpiling a few models that are not readily usable.
It requires Leo contract for every instance of ML for verification which makes it so inefficient for running a machine learning algorithm service using Aleo Chain. 
Because just transpiling to Leo program which is not specifically designed for only ML is inferior than **ML-purpose(like matrix operation) native low-level varuna circuit**.  


# Solution

Aleo EZKL library provides a new framework for zkML inference that operates

- Offchain Proving: Any computational model, including Pytorch(superstar at ml) and Tensorflow, can be pointed to and the proof can be generated through **Varuna native low-level circuit**. By leveraging **prover network** , Aleo can take ZKML-Application narratives for privacy-preserving manner. But it is matter of speed. **The computing power of the prover alone is not sufficient to achieve the speed necessary for a comfortable user experience (UX). This is because ZKML SDK is currently transpiling to Leo. Therefore, we need to create ZKML models using low-level circuits that are native to Varuna proof systems, which are at a lower level, and integrate them with Leo Application program module.**

- Onchain Verification: The proof is verified through Validators and even Leo contract so that the results can be further used onchain.

# System Architecture

I'll explain by example.

### System Flow

Aleo EZKL provides an inference model that consists of

- Pre-trained model: Prepare ML model implemented and trained by pytorch, tensorflow, etc ... 
- Pre-trained model to ONNX: Convert the model to ONNX, which is a universal ML model technology graph
- Varuna-native Circuit: Conver the ONXX to Varuna-native circuit which is more faster than LEO 
- Intergration with Leo application program(Optional): Intergration ML circuit with Leo Program module which is using ZKML in its logic.
- Deploy: After intergration, the package which is consist of ML circuit and Leo program will be deployed at Validator and Prover.
- Off-chain Computation: Prover network compute with its heavy computational power and makes proof in fast way(Thanks to the speed of the 'native' Varuna Circuit).

### Details

- Computational Algorithm: Machine learning algorithms like Pytorch and Tensorflow
- Proof Generation: Generate zk Proof using Aleo’s Varuna circuit
- Onchain Contract: Even LEO contract with `makeproof()` or `verify()` to verify the proof onchain %% 이 부분은 다시 생각해보기... %%
# Impact

- General Purpose Inference Library: Provide a library and a tool to generate proof on Aleo using any Machine Learning algorithm compatible with
- Private Machine Learning Apps on Aleo: Onchain verified machine learning allows running onchain programs without revealing the input data

# Questions / Requests

- Can I append my ZKML intergration submodule to [SnarkVM](https://github.com/AleoNet/snarkVM)? (Of course, the module will not have side effect to origin snarkvm).
